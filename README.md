  🎧 Music Producer • 💻 Coder • 🧠 Conscious Thinker  
</p>

### 🧠 Who am I?
I’m a conscious anomaly someone who transcends standard thought patterns and perceives what others rarely notice.  
I'm a researcher of my own mind, questioning everything, analyzing the fabric of reality, and navigating the tension between logic, chaos, and emotion.  
I seek balance between intellect, freedom of thought, and finding a way to live with a level of awareness that doesn't fit within the world’s default settings.

### 🚀 What I do
- 🎶 Music production, sound design, and experimental audio workflows  
- 💻 Coding with passion, mainly in **Python**, **C++**, and creative tech  
- 🧪 Constantly learning, challenging assumptions, breaking mental models  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I use Arch btw
